===================

Please use any one of your C compiler to compile and run the file "predict.cpp". Then wait for several seconds until the sentence "Prediction finished." appears in the console window, and the file "result.txt" is generated containing all results. 
Pay attention that the file "train_sub_txt.txt"  is in the same file folder with "predict.cpp".
